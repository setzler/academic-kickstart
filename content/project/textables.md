`textables` is an R package for producing highly-customized LaTeX tables.

Simply install using `devtools::install_github("setzler/textables")`, then the entire data preparation and estimation process is performed in one line using the `ES` command.

100% of the tables in these papers were made using `textables`:
- "Imperfect Competition, Compensating Differentials and Rent Sharing in the U.S. Labor Market," by Lamadon, Mogstad, and Setzler.
- "The Effects of Foreign Multinationals on Workers and Firms in the United States," by Setzler and Tintelnot.
- "Imperfect Competition and Rents in Labor and Product Markets: The Case of the Construction Industry," by Kroft, Luo, Mogstad, and Setzler.
- "How Much Should we Trust Estimates of Firm Effects and Worker Sorting?" by Bonhomme, Holzheu, Lamadon, Manresa, Mogstad, and Setzler.
