Several faculty have asked how I make pourover coffee in my office. Here are the instructions.

### Shopping List

1. **18oz Clever Coffee Dripper.** Costs around $40 [here](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B081GQQ7NH/).
2. **Filters for Clever Dripper.** 100 of these cost around $20 [here](https://www.amazon.com/Coffee-Filters-Designed-Clever-Dripper/dp/B07RV48L1W/).
3. **A Conical Burr Grinder.** Consider the OXO grinder for under $100 [here](https://www.amazon.com/OXO-BREW-Conical-Coffee-Grinder/dp/B07CSKGLMM/).
4. **A Gooseneck Electric Kettle with Temperature Presets.** There are many options under $100, e.g., the Cosori kettle [here](https://www.amazon.com/COSORI-Electric-Gooseneck-Variable-Stainless/dp/B07T1CH2HH/).


### Pourover Instructions

1. **Grind:** Grind coffee beans until you have about 30g of medium-coarse coffee. The granules should be visible like coarse sand and sea salt. You cannot use powder for this, which is why store-bought pre-ground coffee will not work. If your grinder allows you to select a number of cups that you are making, select 2 cups. Note: grinding coffee is messy and loud, so grind it at home and bring it to the office in a vacuum-sealed container.
2. **Heat:** Fill the kettle with water and heat it to 190 Degrees. If you are in a hurry, 175 degrees is almost as good.
3. **Fill:** Place the filter in the Clever dripper. Fill it with the ground coffee. Pour in the water, wetting all of the coffee, until the water is about 1cm from spilling over the top of the filter. Because it uses immersion, the Clever dripper does not require any pouring skill -- just pour the water in.
4. **Wait:** Wait about 3 minutes. If you wait more than 5 minutes, it tastes over-extracted and bitter.
5. **Finish:** Set the Clever dripper on top of a coffee mug. The brewed coffee should start dripping out of the bottom of the Clever dripper into the coffee mug. When the Clever dripper is empty of standing water, you are done.




### Selecting Coffee Beans

There are two main coffee origins:

- **Latin American coffee:** This coffee is rich in chocolate and nut flavor notes. It is typically the only option at chain restaurants like Starbucks.
- **African coffee:** This coffee is rich in fruit and floral notes. It is hard to find: even specialty coffee shops often only have one African coffee available, and you have to specifically request it.

The reason the coffee in my office smells so good is because I only buy African coffee, which smells like fruits instead of nuts. African coffee is typically not available in stores. Instead, you can order African coffee from the best roasters using Mistobox:

- [Tendem Coffee Roasters](https://www.mistobox.com/roaster-name/tandem-coffee-roasters)
- [Barefoot Coffee Roasters](https://www.mistobox.com/roaster-name/barefoot-coffee-roasters)
- [1000 Faces Coffee](https://www.mistobox.com/roaster-name/1000-faces)
- [Brandywine Coffee Roasters](https://www.mistobox.com/roaster-name/brandywine-coffee-roasters)
- [Evans Brothers](https://www.mistobox.com/roaster-name/evans-brothers-coffee-roasters)

I recommend starting with Tandem. Make sure you order coffee that is from Africa (most commonly from Ethiopia) and that you order whole beans (not ground).
