Visiting faculty often ask how I make such good coffee in my office. Here are instructions.

### Shopping List:

1. **18oz Clever Coffee Dripper.** You can buy this for around $40 [here](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B081GQQ7NH/).
2. **Filters for Clever Dripper.** You can buy 100 of these for around $20 [here](https://www.amazon.com/Coffee-Filters-Designed-Clever-Dripper/dp/B07RV48L1W/).
3. **A Conical Burr Grinder.** You can buy a simple coffee grinder for $100 or less, such as the OXO grinder [here](https://www.amazon.com/OXO-BREW-Conical-Coffee-Grinder/dp/B07CSKGLMM/).
4. **A Gooseneck Electric Kettle with Temperature Preset.** You can buy an electric kettle with temperature presets for less than $100, such as the Cosori kettle [here](https://www.amazon.com/COSORI-Electric-Gooseneck-Variable-Stainless/dp/B07T1CH2HH/).


### Pourover Instructions

1. **Grind the coffee:** Grind coffee beans to medium-coarse. The granules should be visible; you do not want powder. You will need about 30g of ground coffee. If your grinder allows you to select a number of cups, select 2 cups.
2. **Heat the water:** Fill the kettle with water and heat it to 190 Degrees. If you are in a hurry, 175 degrees is almost as good.
3. **Fill the dripper:** Put the filter in the Clever dripper. Fill it with the ground coffee. Pour in the water, wetting all of the coffee, until the water is about 1cm from spilling over the top of the filter. Because it uses immersion, the Clever dripper does not require any pouring skill -- just pour the water in.
4. **Wait:** Wait 3-5 minutes. 
5. **Finish:** Set the Clever dripper on top of a coffee mug. The brewed coffee should start dripping out of the bottom of the Clever dripper into the coffee mug. When the Clever dripper is empty of standing water, you are done.

Note: grinding coffee is messy and loud, so I suggest grinding it at home and bringing it to the office in a vacuum-sealed container.


### Selecting Coffee Beans

There are two main coffee origins:

- **Latin American coffee:** This coffee is rich in chocolate and nut flavor notes. It is typically the only option at chain restaurants like Starbucks.
- **African coffee:** This coffee is rich in fruit and floral notes. It is hard to find: even specialty coffee shops often only have one African coffee available, and you have to specifically request it.

The reason the coffee in my office smells so good is because I only buy African coffee, which smells like fruits instead of nuts. African coffee is typically not available in stores. Instead, you can order African coffee from the best roasters using Mistobox:

- [Tendem Coffee Roasters](https://www.mistobox.com/roaster-name/tandem-coffee-roasters)
- [Barefoot Coffee Roasters](https://www.mistobox.com/roaster-name/barefoot-coffee-roasters)
- [1000 Faces Coffee](https://www.mistobox.com/roaster-name/1000-faces)
- [Brandywine Coffee Roasters](https://www.mistobox.com/roaster-name/brandywine-coffee-roasters)
- [Evans Brothers](https://www.mistobox.com/roaster-name/evans-brothers-coffee-roasters)

I recommend starting with Tandem. Make sure you order coffee that is from Africa (most commonly from Ethiopia) and that you order whole beans (not ground).
