The following is advice for a hypothetical faculty member who is organizing a seminar day for an external visitor. It is based on my own trial-and-error from organizing a seminar for the first time as an assistant professor at Penn State.


### Overview: 

During a typical seminar visit, an external visitor travels to a university, spends the day meeting with local faculty, is taken to lunch and dinner, and presents research during a seminar. The local organizer has four responsibilities:

1. Inviting the speaker and following-up by email;
2. Arranging a meeting schedule between the speaker and local faculty and students;
3. Managing the seminar environment.

I will now provide some tips related to each of these steps.




### 1. Inviting the speaker and following-up by email:

*1.1 Provide the basic information:* When inviting a speaker to visit your institution, all they need to know is:

- The name of the seminar and/or the type of audience expected;
- The available dates from which to choose;
- The general outline for how the visit day will be spent (one-on-one meetings, dinner, etc.); and,
- Clarification regarding who will book and pay for the travel-related expenses.

Here is a complete invitation email:

> Dear Michael,
> 
> Hope all is well! I am organizing the Penn State Trade & Development Seminar this year and would like to invite you to visit. 
> 
> The seminar is 75-minutes on Monday afternoons, with one-on-one meetings scheduled throughout the day. A student lunch and faculty dinner are also included. We will book the hotel and reimburse travel expenses. 
>
> The following dates are currently available for your visit:
> 
> Sept 18
>
> Sept 25
>
> Oct 23
> 
> Please let me know which date works best for you. Hope you can make it! 
> 
> Brad Setzler


*1.2. Confirm and provide an administrative contact:* After the speaker replies with a chosen date, reply to let them know that the visit date is confirmed, as well as to provide them with the email address of an administrator whom they may contact to answer questions related to travel arrangements. Providing a contact person is especially important, as travel arrangements can be complicated, e.g., due to restrictions on financial reimbursements for government employees, visa issues for foreign travel, etc.


### 2. Arranging a meeting schedule:

The goal of a meeting schedule is to provide the opportunity for as many local faculty and/or students as possible to have an active and engaged discussion about research with the visitor, typically in 30-minute meeting blocks. Here are some tips to ensure that those meetings are productive.


*2.1. Provide the full name and website for each faculty meeting:* For some reason, it is common to provide visitors with a meeting schedule that says:

> 11:00 AM - Meet with John

John is a very common name. It will be difficult for the speaker to prepare for a meeting with John if they do not know which John will be in the meeting. Even for less common names, the speaker should not have to search the faculty directory to uncover the last name of the individuals with whom they are meeting -- provide the last names by default. Also, make sure to indicate if the individual is a faculty member, a visitor, a student, the provost, or another position.

Furthermore, the visitors will likely want to familiarize themselves with the research of the local faculty member prior to the meeting. This is a good thing to be encouraged from the perspective of that local faculty member. To make it easier for the visitor to learn about your faculty's work, provide a link to the local faculty member's website by default. See the template below for an example of how to do this.


*2.2. Schedule breaks for your visitors by default:* For some reason, most seminar schedules do not include breaks between meetings. However, human beings need breaks throughout the day for several good reasons:

- **Family considerations:** Visitors are leaving their dependents behind to spend the day at your institution. However, they often need to check in with family throughout the day to ensure that the necessary care is being provided. Examples include children who need to be taken to and from daycare, elderly family members who need to be given medication at the correct intervals, and pets that need to be given food and water. 

- **Restroom visits:** The average human being needs to use the restroom 7 times per day, while older people and people suffering from certain health conditions can require substantially more restroom visits, according to the [Cleveland Clinic](https://health.clevelandclinic.org/how-often-should-you-pee). This means it is typical for a healthy human to require a restroom break once every 2-3 hours, and requiring more restroom visits is not unusual. Naturally, many of those 7+ visits will need to occur during the seminar day.

- **Medication:** Many people suffer from health conditions that require intraday maintenance. For example, 11\% of all Americans -- and nearly 30\% of all seniors -- have diabetes, according to the [American Diabetes Association](https://diabetes.org/about-diabetes/statistics/about-diabetes#:~:text=Prevalence%3A%20In%202021%2C%2038.4%20million,of%20the%20population%2C%20had%20diabetes.&text=Diagnosed%20and%20undiagnosed%3A%20Of%20the,and%208.7%20million%20were%20undiagnosed.). Diabetes often requires active management, such as injecting insulin prior to meals or eating small meals throughout the day to maintain proper glucose levels. This is only one example; many other chronic illnesses such as asthma, Crohn's disease, and arthritis may require medication taken throughout the day. 

Given that your visitors absolutely require regular breaks, schedule those breaks on their behalf. Do not force your visitors to awkwardly explain the personal reasons why they need to leave a meeting early.
