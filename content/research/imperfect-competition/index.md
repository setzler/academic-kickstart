abstract: "We quantify the importance of imperfect competition in the U.S. labor market by estimating the size of labor market rents earned by American firms and workers. We construct a matched employer-employee panel data set by combining the universe of U.S. business and worker tax records for the period 2001â€“2015. Using this panel data, we identify and estimate an equilibrium model of the labor market with two-sided heterogeneity where workers view forms as imperfect substitutes because of heterogeneous preferences over non-wage job characteristics. The model allows us to draw inference about imperfect competition, worker sorting, compensating differentials, and rent sharing."
